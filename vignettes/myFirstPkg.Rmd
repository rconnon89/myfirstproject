myFirstPkg is designed to help me make my first steps as an awesome package developer. Steph says it'll make me in the top 5% of devs **EVERYWHERE**!

## Core functionality
At this point in time, key aspects of the package are:

- `circleArea` for calculating the area of a circle given the radius

## Using the package
### `circleArea`
Use `circleArea` to calculate the area of a circle given vectors. Note that this does not do any unit management.

```{r}
library(myFirstPkg)
circleArea(1)
circleArea(2:5)
```
